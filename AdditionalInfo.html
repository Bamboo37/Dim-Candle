<td style="vertical-align:text-top;">
	<p id="paragraph"> &emsp; &emsp; For most of my life I've always been fascinated with science, especially astronomy. When I was young I used to read and research various things in astronomy. I used to watch vidoes of Niel DeGrasse Tyson on the topic. When I got to middle school I started to find myself more admist philosophy than science.</p>
	<p id="paragraph"> &emsp; &emsp; I started to think more for myself and what my morals/ethics were. At the time I didn't really realize this; I just enjoyed thinking about things. I would often reflect on my day, sometimes think about science and theories, and then think about whatever crossed my mind.</p>
	<p id="paragraph"> &emsp; &emsp; During my sophomore year of highschool is when I began to get interested in topics of pseudosciece, specifically because of World History. Our final was to research a specific topic throughout the whole year and then share it to the class. I did mine on both math and science.</p>
	<p id="paragraph"> &emsp; &emsp; I primarily held my focus on math, for that it was the topic I was much more interested in. While researching I found that our current education system in the United States was poorly done. Alongside that, I also learned about some pseudosciences (which I stayed away from researching)</p>

	<p id="paragraph"> &emsp; &emsp; Eventually I found myself getting curious about alternative medicine. I wondered if these therapies were effective, this led me to pseudoscience. My interest in astronomy helped me get started by getting me to one of Carl Sagan's books, <i>The Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</i>. It's a very good book on the topics of scientific literacy and pseudoscience; Sagan delves deep into the topics and just shows how poor the scientific literacy in the U.S. is.</p>
	<p id="paragraph"> &emsp; &emsp; After reading that, I really got interested into pseudoscience. I began to realize just how prominent it is in our culture. To be honest, I never had expected chiropractics to be primarily scam. I had heard so many good things about it, my mom used to go to a chiropractor, and yet it turns out it's nothing more than folklore. I had also heard good things about acupuncture in school so when I learned that it was a pseudoscience, I was genuinely shocked. I hadn't expected something I learned in school to be false, which led me back to education in the United States.</p>
	<p id="paragraph"> &emsp; &emsp; Now I feel strongly against pseudoscience and anything that condones it. If it is true that science was nothing more than a coincidence, I would hate for us to lose our knowledge of it. History has taught us that we as humans make mistakes, and we make them a lot. Psuedoscience has followed us through ancient times to today. So many people across the world believe in science, but when there is lies in the midst of it, we're bound to falter and return to the state of ancient civilizations. We might go back to being witch hunters and persecuting people of whom we disagree with. We'll fight lies with lies. Science will just be a small remament of human history.</p>
	
	<h1 style="text-align:center;">Intellectual Dimension</h1>
	<p id="paragraph"> &emsp; &emsp; This relates specifically to the intellectual dimension of the seven dimensions due to the gaining of knowledge. It's important to understand the difference between science and pseudoscience because it helps you make better decisions and be more engaged in scientific practices. It also allows you to gauge how reliable a source may be and distinquish both the pros and cons of an experimental design.</p>
	<p id="paragraph"> &emsp; &emsp; This may sound counterintuitive but it also can help being more open minded (though that is the exact opposite of how this has sounded up to this point). Understanding the basic principles of science and having the tools to tell against sham science allows you to be more open minded. Every pseudoscience I've listed isn't necessarily false, there is just no evidence to support them. If evidence did show up however I would have no problems changing my opinions on that topic. The goal of science is to learn the truth; to do that, one must be open minded about new ideas and theories but at the same time you must be weary of sham theories and stay alert. That is what the intellectual dimension is: being open minded and gaining wisdom.</p>
